# Redux advanced

 **Redux** is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.

### **What is createSlice in Redux Toolkit?**
createSlice is a higher order function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions and a slice name. It automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.


### To use redux to build an application, follow these steps:

Step 1: Implement createSilce method and export actions and reducer.

* First, import the createSlice method from the redux-toolkit library.
* Make use of createSlice method to create your slice.
* The Slice created above contains all the values required to create a reducer. Now we need to export the actions and the reducer.


Step 2: Dispatch action by making use of react hooks in functional component.

* Now we need to make use of the react hooks useSelector to read the state and useDispatch to dispatch the action created in slice. Letâ€™s implement and see how the app works.


Step 3: Configure the store

* Now we need to connect our store to the app. Here configureStore({}) wraps createStore() to simplify the configuration for us. createStore() is a redux store that holds the complete state tree of your app.
