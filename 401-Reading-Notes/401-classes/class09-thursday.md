* What's the difference between Stack and Queue?

In stack, we can insert and delete from the end of the stack only, with a concept of LIFO (Last In First Out).

In queue, we can insert an object from one side and delete it from the other side, FIFO(First In First Out) 
* What is Stacks and how to use it?

Stack is a linear data structure that follows the specific order to perform the operations.  In the stack, we insert the element from one end with push operation and delete the element from the same end using pop operation.

* What is Queue?

The queue is a linear data structure in which we can insert the element from one side of the list and delete the element from the other side of the list.
