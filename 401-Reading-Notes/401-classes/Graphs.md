# Graphs 

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. Properties of Graphs are basically used for the characterization of graphs depending on their structures. We defined these properties in specific terms that pertain to the domain of graph theory. In this article, we are going to discuss some properties of Graphs these are as follows:

Distance between two Vertices:

 It is basically the number of edges that are available in the shortest path between vertex A and vertex B.If there is more than one edge which is used to connect two vertices then we basically considered the shortest path as the distance between these two vertices.

 ## Types of Graphs:

1. Finite Graphs
2. Infinite Graph
3. Trivial Graph 
4. Simple Graph
5. Multi Graph
6. Null Graph
7. Complete Graph
8. Pseudo Graph
9. Regular Graph
10. Bipartite Graph
11. Labeled Graph
12. Digraph Graph
13. Subgraph
14. Connected or Disconnected Graph
15. Cyclic Graph
