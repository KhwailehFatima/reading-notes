# Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

  The mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. If you walk into a music hall at a local university, you’ll hear people ‘playing’ by running through their pieces. This is a huge mistake. Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety.

  ## The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:
 * Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
* Repeated often
* Feedback on results in continuously available
* It's highly demanding mentally
* It's difficult
* It requires good goals


# Measuring Emotional Intelligence

*  I am aware of the physical reactions (twinges, aches, 
sudden changes) that signal a “gut reaction.”
 
 *  When I feel angry I can still stay composed.
 *  I  generally have an accurate idea of how another person 
perceives me during a particular interaction

# Assessing Bias
